Filtering Step 1	Discard reads below minimum quality threshold
Filtering Step 2	Check of bacterial contamination; discard offending reads
Filtering Step 3	Discard reads with common uncalled characters (e.g. N)
Filtering Step 4	Remove reads from pair-end libraries that were orphaned by filtering steps 1-3
# Insert size and standard deviation	Calculated for each library from BAM files obtained by mapping a random sample (one million reads) of each FASTQ file against transcriptome reference (Ensembl release: 70)
Read Mapping	Against genome reference (Ensembl release: 70) tophat1 version:  1.4.1
