Protocol Name	P-MEXP-9605	P-MTAB-4455	P-MTAB-4456	P-MTAB-4458
Protocol Type	nucleic_acid_extraction	labeling	hybridization	bioassay_data_transformation
Protocol Description	RNA was extracted using TriZol standard protocol	"Labeled miRNAs is obtained, according to Agilent's protocols, from 500 ng of total RNA through the ligation of a 5ﾒ-cytidine bisphosphate-Cy3 (pCp-Cy3, Agilent Technologies) group at the 3ﾒ-end of each miRNA. To enhance the T4 RNA-ligase (Promega) efficiency, total RNA is previously treated with Alkaline Phosphatase (Amersham). Labeled miRNAs is purified by chromatography columns (Micro Biospin 6, Biorad)."	Hybridizations are performed at 55ﾰC for 17 hours in a rotating oven.	"Microarray results are analyzed by using the GeneSpring GX 7.3 software (Agilent Technologies). Data files are pre-processed using the GeneSpring plug-in for Agilent Feature Extraction software results. Data transformation is applied to set all the negative raw values at 5.0, followed by on-chip median normalization. "
