Experiment Description	In order to investigate the genes differentially expressed between osteosarcoma and their normal bone counterpart we carried out class comparisons algorithms in BRB-ArrayTools with the paired t test.The CEL files were imported and robust multi-array averaging normalized. Genes whose expression differed by at least 1.5-fold from the median in at least 20% of the arrays were used.

Protocol Description	TRIzol (Invitrogen) followed by DNase digestion (Turbo-DNase-Ambion)<br><br><br>(Parameters: Extracted product = total_RNA, Amplification = none)	Biopsy specimens were kept at 4 degrees C in RNAlater for up to 1 week, then stored at -80 degrees C. When formal pathologic interpretation of histology from other portions of the biopsy specimen rendered a diagnosis of osteosarcoma, the RNA-preserving tissue specimens were banked and annotated. Control samples were derived from to-be-discarded bone fragments obtained from similarly consented patients undergoing debridement surgeries for acute, traumatic injuries to the long bones.
