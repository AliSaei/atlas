Protocol Description	Plants of the rice (O. sativa) reference genotype cv. Nipponbare (International Rice Genome Sequencing Project 2005) were grown under growth chamber conditions (28degreesC/26degreesC day/night temperatures and 10-h photoperiod) and fertilized once a week with 20-20-20 fertilizer (N:P:K) until seed set.	Total RNA was isolated using a modified hot phenol method. One gram of tissue was ground with liquid N and immediately transferred into a mixture of prewarmed phenol (pH 4.3) and extraction buffer (100 mmol LiCl, 100 mmol Tris pH 8.5, 10 mmol ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, and 15 mmol dithiothreitol), vortexed, and incubated at 60degreesC for 20 min. Chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (24:1) was added and the mixture was vortexed and centrifuged at 11,000 rpm for 10 min at 4degreesC. The aqueous phase was transferred into phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1), vortexed, and centrifuged at 11,000 rpm for 10 min at 4degreesC. The previous step was repeated twice with phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) and twice with chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (24:1). The RNA pellet was precipitated with 4 M LiCl, washed with 70% ethanol, and dissolved in diethylpyrocarbonate water. Genomic DNA was removed by deoxyribonuclease (DNase) treatment using the DNA-Free kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). RNA quantity was determined using a Nanodrop (Thermo Scientific, Wilmington, DE), and RNA quality was checked using an Agilent bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA).	Approximately 5 to 10 ug of total RNA was used for construction of each RNA-seq library. Polyadenylated RNA purification, RNA fragmentation, cDNA synthesis, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification was performed according to the Illumina RNA-seq protocol (Cat number RS-100-0801, Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA).
