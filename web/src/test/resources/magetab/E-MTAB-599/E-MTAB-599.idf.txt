Protocol Description	Mouse tissues where obtained from 8 weeks old mice from the Jackson lab Maine USA.	Total RNA extraction using trizol as per manufacturer instructions	The samples were sequenced on an Illumina Genome Analyser II.	SRF files were generated using the standard method for the Illumina platform. Base calling was performed with phred quality scores at 64 levels using Illumina GApipeline v1.8.67.0. There were 152 cycles of sequencing with 2 reads per cluster.	SRF files were generated using the standard method for the Illumina platform. Base calling was performed with phred quality scores at 64 levels using Illumina GApipeline v1.8.70.0. There were 152 cycles of sequencing with 2 reads per cluster.	SRF files were generated using the standard method for the Illumina platform. Base calling was performed with phred quality scores at 64 levels using Illumina GApipeline v1.6.0a14. There were 152 cycles of sequencing with 2 reads per cluster.	SRF files were generated using the standard method for the Illumina platform. Base calling was performed with phred quality scores at 64 levels using Illumina GApipeline v1.6.1. There were 152 cycles of sequencing with 2 reads per cluster.
