Filtering Step 1	Discard reads below minimum quality threshold
Filtering Step 2	Check of bacterial contamination; discard offending reads
Filtering Step 3	Discard reads with common ambiguous characters (e.g. N)
Filtering step 4	Remove reads from pair-end libraries that were orphaned by filtering steps 1-3

Transcript Assembly	cufflinks1 version: 1.3.0 (no novel transcript assembly)
Normalized counts per Gene	Sum of FPKMs of all its transcripts, then averaged for all biological replicates (if any)
