Protocol Description	Drosophila mutant larvae were reared on standard cornmeal-agar-molasses medium at 25C. The Oregon R strain larvae of the same stage were used as the control.	Total RNA was extracted from ten larvae (triplicate for each genotype) with 1ml of Trizol Regent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturers instructions. RNA quality was evaluated using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent).	Each of six Affymetrix Drosophila Genome arrays was hybridized for 16-18 hrs with biotin-labeled fragmented cRNA (10 ug) in 200 ul hybridization mixture according to the manufacturer's protocol.	Arrays were washed and stained using GeneChip Fluidic Station 450 and hybridization signals were amplified using antibody amplification with goat IgG (Sigma-Aldrich) and anti-streptavidin biotinylated antibody. Chips were scanned on Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner 3000 using Affymetrix Command Console Software.	Raw data were normalized using Robust Multichip Average and normalized to control samples with GeneSpring GX 11.0.2 software (Agilent).
