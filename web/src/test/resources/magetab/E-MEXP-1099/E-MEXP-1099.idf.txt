Experiment Description	"Comparison of wild type and heterozygote and homozygote chico mutants ( Clancy, et al. Extension of Life-Span by Loss of CHICO, a Drosophila Insulin Receptor Substrate Protein. Science 292 (5514), 104.) on Affymetrix Drosophila2 GeneChip.  The flies (Drosophila melanogaster) are 7 day old adult females."				
Protocol Name	P-MEXP-54454	P-AFFY-2	Affymetrix:Protocol:Hybridization-Unknown	P-AFFY-6	P-MEXP-60168
Protocol Type	nucleic_acid_extraction	labeling	hybridization	feature_extraction	bioassay_data_transformation
Protocol Description	"Samples were homogenised in 1ml Trizol (Invitrogen) in FastPrep tubes (Lysing Matrix D, Q-Biogene) using a bead mill (Hybaid Ribolyser). Total RNA was isolated using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) and the RNeasy (Qiagen) kit, following the manufacturers' instructions. For the RNA precipitation step in the Trizol protocol, 200ul 70% DEPC-treated H2O-ethanol was used, and this volume was then applied directly onto RNeasy mini columns. The RNeasy protocol was then followed from the RW1 wash step onwards. RNA concentration determined using an Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent Technologies, CA, US)."	Title: Affymetrix in vitro transcription. Description: 	Title: Affymetrix Generic Hybridization. Description: 	Title: Affymetrix CEL analysis. Description: 	"Before normalization all probesets with absent target transcripts were removed (Schuster et al. Correcting for sequence biases in present/absent calls. Genome Biology (2007) In Press).  The remaining probesets were normalized with the ""GoldenSpike"" method which uses 8 different normalizations based on MAS 5.0 background correction, loess/quantiles/invariantset/constant probe-level normalization, mas/medianpolish probe summary and loess probeset-level normalization (Choe, et al. Preferred analysis methods for Affymetrix GeneChips revealed by a wholly defined control dataset. Genome Biology. 2005, 6:R16).  ""GoldenSpike"" intensity levels obtained by averaging the normalized raw intensity values produced using eight different normalization methods."
