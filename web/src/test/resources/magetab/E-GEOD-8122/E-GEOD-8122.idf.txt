Experiment Description	Tristetraprolin is a vertebrate CCCH tandem zinc finger protein that can bind to and destabilize certain mRNAs containing AU-rich element binding sites. zfs1 is the single gene in the fission yeast, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, that encodes a protein containing the critical features of the tristetraprolin zinc finger domain. zfs1 has been linked to pheromone signal transduction control and to the coordination of mitosis, but no biological function has been ascribed to the zfs1 protein. Through a functional genomics approach we compared transcript levels in wild-type and zfs1-deficient S. pombe strains; those elevated in the zfs1-deficient strain were examined for the presence of potential tristetraprolin-like binding sites. One such potential target transcript was encoded by arz1, a gene encoding a protein of unknown function that contains armadillo repeats. arz1 mRNA decay was inhibited in the zfs1-deficient strain when it was expressed under the control of a thiamine-repressible promoter. Mutations within one AU-rich element present in the arz1 3prime-untranslated region protected this transcript from zfs1-promoted decay, whereas mutating another potential binding site had no effect. Binding assays confirmed a direct interaction between zfs1 and arz1 mRNA-based probes; this interaction was eliminated when key residues were mutated in either zfs1 zinc finger. zfs1 and its targets in S. pombe represent a useful model system for studies of zinc finger protein/AU-rich element interactions that result in mRNA decay. Experiment Overall Design: S. pombe wild-type and zfs1-deficient strains were grown to 1.0 A600 in EMM+5S at 30C for steady state analysis.  Total cellular RNA was prepared from four replicate cultures.

Protocol Type	grow	nucleic_acid_extraction	labeling	hybridization	feature_extraction
Protocol Description	Strains were grown at 30C in Edinburgh Minimal Medium (EMM) supplemented with 50 mg/l of adenine, histidine, leucine, lysine and uracil each (EMM+5S) or with SP minus leu (EMM+4S-Leu) when transformed (media and supplements were purchased from Q-biogene, Morgan, CA.	Cells from 1.5 ml of culture were centrifuged at 16,100 Ã g for 1 min at room temperature and total RNA was harvested from the cell pellet after storage at -80Â&deg;C using the MasterPure yeast RNA purification kit (Epicenter, Madison, WI).	Starting with 1ug of total RNA, biotin-labeled cRNA was produced using the Affymetrix 3â Amplification One-Cycle Target labeling kit according to manufacturerâs protocol.
