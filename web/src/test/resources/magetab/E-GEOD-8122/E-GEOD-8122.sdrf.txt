GSE8122GSM200852	Schizosaccharomyces pombe	zfs1 mutant	S.pombe strain with zfs1 deficiency:  Gene expression analysis was conducted using C. Elegans Genome Genechip???? arrays (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA).  Starting with 1ug of total RNA, biotin-labeled cRNA was produced using the Affymetrix 3?????? Amplification One-Cycle Target labeling kit according to manufacturer??????s protocol.  For each array, 5ug of amplified cRNAs were fragmented and hybridized to the array for 16 hours in a rotating hybridization oven using the Affymetrix Eukaryotic Target Hybridization Controls and protocol.  Slides were stained and washed as indicated in the Antibody Amplification Stain for Eukaryotic Targets protocol using the Affymetrix Fluidics Station FS450 with the Mini_euk2v3 protocol.  Arrays were then scanned with an Affymetrix Scanner 3000.  Data was obtained using the Genechip???? Operating Software..
