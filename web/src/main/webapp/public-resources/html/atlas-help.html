<div id="cutoff">Enter a minimum expression level (FPKM) cut-off. Only genes with expression
    above this level will be displayed. The default cut-off is 0.5; if you would like to
    see results for the entire data set, change this to 0.
    FPKM stands for "fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads", and
    is a normalized measure of expression used in RNA-sequencing analysis.
    For more details, see http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v28/n5/full/nbt.1621.html.</div>
<div id="barchart">The histogram shows the number of genes (y-axis) expressed above expression
    level cutoffs (x-axis) for the chosen tissues. You can use it to help you choose a minimum cut-off. Click on a
    bar to select its expression level as the minimum cut-off.</div>
