<div id="geneSearch">Enter Ensembl gene ID(s), gene symbol(s) or keywords. Leave blank for all genes.
</div>

<div id="factorSearch">Select experimental factor value(s). Factor values are experimental variables, e.g. different tissues or cell types.
</div>

<div id="filterBy">Select factor value(s) to limit results by.
</div>

<div id="specific">Check to sort by genes specific to factor value(s) selected. Uncheck to sort by highest expressed genes.
</div>

<div id="cutoff">Enter a minimum expression level (FPKM). Only genes expressed
	above this are displayed. Set to 0 to retrieve all genes.
</div>

<div id="gene-distribution">The histogram shows number of genes (y-axis)
	expressed above each expression level (x-axis). Click a bar to select its expression level as the minimum.
