<!-- request requestPreferences -->
<div id="geneSearch">Enter Ensembl gene ID(s), gene symbol(s) or keywords. Leave blank for all genes.
</div>

<div id="experimentalConditions">Enter experimental factor value(s). Factor values are experimental variables, e.g. different tissues or cell types.
</div>

<div id="filterBy">Select factor value(s) to limit results by.
</div>

<div id="specific">Check to see genes specific to factor value(s) selected, with most specific genes first. Uncheck to sort by highest expressed genes.
</div>

<div id="specific-differential">Check to see genes specific to contrast(s) selected, with most specific genes first. Uncheck to sort by highest absolute log<sub>2</sub> fold-change.
</div>

<div id="factorSearch">Select experimental factor value(s). Factor values are experimental variables, e.g. different tissues or cell types.
</div>

<div id="factorSearch-differential">Select contrast(s). A contrast compares two groups of assays: the test to the reference. Each group is described by a set of properties/values that are constant across all assays in that group.
</div>

<div id="cutoff">Enter a minimum expression level (FPKM). Only genes expressed
	above this are displayed. Set to 0 to retrieve all genes.
</div>

<div id="cutoff-differential">Enter value from 0 to 1 to use as the maximum <i>p</i>-value cutoff.
    Only genes that show differential expression with an adjusted <i>p</i>-value at or below this cutoff will be shown.
</div>

<div id="foldChangeCutOff">Enter value equal or greater than 0 to use as the minimum absolute log<sub>2</sub>-fold change.
    Only genes that show absolute log<sub>2</sub>-fold change at or greater than this cutoff will be shown.
</div>

<div id="gene-distribution">The histogram shows number of genes (y-axis)
	expressed above each expression level (x-axis). Click a bar to select its expression level as the minimum.
</div>

<div id="toggleHistogramButton">Toggle display of histogram showing distribution of expression levels.
</div>

<div id="slider">Choose a minimum expression level.
</div>

<!--experiment -->
<div id="gradient-base">Expression level: greater colour saturation means higher expression.
</div>

<div id="gradient-differential">Greater colour saturation means higher absolute log<sub>2</sub>-fold change value.
    Blue indicates the gene is down–regulated and red means up–regulated.
</div>


<div id="heatMapTableCellInfo">Filled boxes indicate genes expressed. Click a box to see transcript breakdown. Click "Display levels" to show expression levels.
</div>

<div id="heatMapTableCellInfo-differential">Filled boxes indicate genes differentially expressed. Mouseover a box to see adjusted <i>p</i>-value and log<sub>2</sub> fold-change. Click "Display log<sub>2</sub> fold-change" to show exact log<sub>2</sub> fold-changes.
</div>

<div id="heatMapTableUnknownCell">Unknown expression level. Gene may or may not be expressed.
