<h1>Expression Atlas data in R</h1>

<p>For <a href="">differential expression</a> experiments in Expression Atlas,
you can download a file containing the expression data and meta-data that you
can load into <a href="">R</a>. Click the button on the top-right of any
differential experiment page to download one.</p>

<h2>How to load an Atlas experiment summary in R</h2>

<p>Start an R session on your computer.</p>

<!-- screenshot of new R session -->

<p>Load the object you downloaded into your R session:</p>

<p><code>load( "/path/to/E-MEXP-1066-atlasExperimentSummary.Rdata" )</code></p>

<p>This has created an object called <code>experimentSummary</code>. This
object is a <a href="">SimpleList</a> object. Each element is one of three <a href="">Bioconductor</a> objects: 
	<ul>
		<li><a href="">SummarizedExperiment</a> (RNA-seq experiments)</li>
		<li><a href="">ExpressionSet</a> (1-colour microarray experiments)</li>
		<li><a href="">MAList</a> (2-colour microarray experiments)</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<h2>How to use it</h2>

<h3>Seeing what's available</h3>
	
<p>Now that you have loaded it, you can access the objects by their names in
the SimpleList. To see these names, type <code>names( experimentSummary )</code>.</p>

<p>The names of objects in a microarray experiment correspond to the <a
href="">ArrayExpress</a> array design accessions used in the experiment. In
our example of <a href="">E-MTAB-1066</a>, only one array design was used,
which is usually the case for microarray experiments in Expression Atlas.
However, sometimes microarray experiments contain more than one data-set, each
of which was done using a different array design. For example, the experiment
&quot;<a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/experiments/E-MEXP-1025">Transcription
profiling by array of spinal cord from rats with experimental autoimmune
encephalomyelitis</a>&quot; uses three different versions of the Affymetrix
GeneChip Rat Genome U34 array (<a
href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/arrays/A-AFFY-18/">A</a>, <a
href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/arrays/A-AFFY-19/">B</a>, and <a
href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/arrays/A-AFFY-20/">C</a>). For this
experiment, the SimpleList object that you load will have three elements, each
one with data from one of the three array versions used.</p>

<p>Expression Atlas SimpleList objects for RNA-seq experiments will always
contain only one element, named <code>rnaseq</code>.</p>

<h3>Accessing the expression data</h3>

<p>First, to keep things simple we assign one of the objects in the SimpleList
to a new variable, by typing e.g. 
	<code>mtab1066_affy35 &lt;- mtab1066_list[[ "A-AFFY-35" ]]</code>
.</p>
