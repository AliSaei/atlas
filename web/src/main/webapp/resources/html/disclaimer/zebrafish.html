    <h3>Data Reuse Statement</h3>
    <br />
    <p>
        This is a pre-publication release in accordance with <a href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/datasharing/"> the Fort Lauderdale Agreement </a>. Feel free to search and download data on your genes of interest.
    </p>
    <p>
        Equally, you can use the dataset to show developmental expression profiles for specific genes in your publications.
    </p>
    <p>
        However, we ask that you refrain from publishing larger scale or genome-wide analyses of this dataset for 12 months from the time of deposition in Expression Atlas or until we have published our transcriptional time-course paper, whichever comes first.
    </p>
    <p>
        For citations in publications before the paper is out please use this link to the Expression Atlas site (<a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/experiments/E-ERAD-475">http://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/experiments/E-ERAD-475</a>) and acknowledge us: “We would like to thank the Busch-Nentwich lab for providing RNA-seq data.”
