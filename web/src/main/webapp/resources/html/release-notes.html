<p>Welcome to the new Expression Atlas service! <a href="http://www-test.ebi.ac.uk/gxa" rel="nofollow" title="http://www-test.ebi.ac.uk/gxa">The old Expression Atlas</a> and its underlying data will no longer be updated or maintained, but limited support will be offered while the process of re-curation, re-analysis and transferring of experiments to the new Expression Atlas is on-going.</p>
<p>
We would like to thank our users for their continuous support, and encourage them to help us shape the new Expression Atlas by: 
<ul>
<li>providing us with feedback via the <img

  align="bottom" /> button on the top right hand side of all Expression Atlas pages, or via <a href="mailto:atlas-feedback@ebi.ac.uk" rel="nofollow" title="mailto:atlas-feedback@ebi.ac.uk">mailto:atlas-feedback@ebi.ac.uk</a>;</li>
<li>contacting us if any experiments of interest are included in the old Expression Atlas, but have not made their way into the new Expression Atlas yet. We will then prioritise their transfer.</li></ul>
