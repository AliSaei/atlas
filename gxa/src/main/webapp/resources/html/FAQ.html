			<h3><a name="whatIsAtlas">What is Expression Atlas</a></h3>
			<p>Expression Atlas is a resource to query gene and protein expression data across species and biological conditions and to visualise down-stream analysis results to explore co-expression. Queries can be either in a <strong>baseline context</strong>, e.g. <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/query?geneQuery=%5B%5D&organism=Macaca%20mulatta&conditionQuery=%5B%7B%22value%22%3A%22brain%22%7D%5D&bs=%7B%22macaca%20mulatta%22%3A%5B%22organism_part%22%5D%7D#baseline">find genes expressed in the macaque brain</a>, or in a <strong>differential context</strong>, e.g. <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/query?geneQuery=%5B%5D&organism=Arabidopsis%20thaliana&conditionQuery=%5B%7B%22value%22%3A%22auxin%22%7D%5D&ds=%7B%22kingdom%22%3A%5B%22plants%22%5D%7D#differential">find genes that are up or downregulated in response to auxin in Arabidopsis</a>. Expression Atlas contains thousands of selected microarray and RNA-sequencing data that are manually curated and annotated with ontology terms, checked for high quality and re-analysed using standardised methods.</p>

			<h3><a name="exptChosen">How are experiments chosen to be in Expression Atlas?</a></h3>
			<p>Experiments in Expression Atlas are selected from <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress">ArrayExpress</a> that is an archive of functional genomics data. Different criteria are used for including experiments in Baseline Atlas or in Differential Atlas. All experiments in <strong>Baseline Atlas</strong> are RNA-seq data with good quality raw files and a broad coverage across conditions (e.g. tissues, cell types, developmental stages). A good quality reference genome build available is also required for RNA-seq data. All experiments in <strong>Differential Atlas</strong> have enough number of replicates to allow robust statistical analysis. Apart from that, microarray data must be gene expression data (rather than ChiP-chip or CGH for example) and it should be possible to re-annotate the array design against <a href="https://www.ensembl.org/index.html">Ensembl</a>.</p>

			<h3><a name="getOrigData">How can I obtain the original data for an experiment?</a></h3>
			<p>The original raw and processed data files for experiments in Expression Atlas can be found by viewing the experiment in <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress">ArrayExpress</a>. On any <strong>Experiment page</strong>, e.g. <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/experiments/E-MTAB-2770">RNA-seq of 934 human cancer cell lines from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia</a> click on the <img alt="array express button" src="resources/images/help/ae_btn.png" align="bottom"> button in the top right corner to view the experiment in ArrayExpress. The original submitted data files can be downloaded as zip archives, and sample annotation is available in MAGE-TAB format text files. See the online tutorial <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/training/online/course/arrayexpress-discover-functional-genomics-data-qui/files-and-download">ArrayExpress: Discover functional genomics data quickly and easily</a> for further information.</p>


			<h3><a name="wholeExpt">It doesn't look like the whole of the original experiment is in Expression Atlas, why not?</a></h3>
			<p>We sometimes only include part of an experiment in Expression Atlas because (1) there are not sufficient replicates of all the sample groups within an experiment, or (2) the hybridization or sequencing was not of high enough quality. If there are still enough assays in the experiment after the removal of those with too few replicates or low quality then we continue processing the experiment for Expression Atlas.</p>


			<h3><a name="arrayQuality">How is microarray data quality controlled?</a></h3>
			<p>Microarray data quality is assessed using the <a href="https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/arrayQualityMetrics.html">arrayQualityMetrics</a> package in <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R</a>. Outlier arrays are detected using distance measures, boxplots, and MA plots. If an array is classed as an outlier by all three methods, it is excluded from further analysis. Please see the arrayQualityMetrics <a href="https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/arrayQualityMetrics/inst/doc/arrayQualityMetrics.pdf">documentation</a> for more details on the methods used.</p>


			<h3><a name="rnaseqQuality">How is RNA-seq data quality controlled?</a></h3>
			<p>RNA-seq reads are discarded based on several criteria. First, reads with quality scores less than Q10 are removed. Second, the reads are mapped against a contamination reference genome (<i>E. coli</i> for animal data, fungal and microbial non-redundant reference for plants). Any reads that map to the contamination reference are removed. Third, reads with "uncalled" characters (i.e. "N"s) are discarded. Lastly, for paired-end libraries, any reads whose mate was lost in the previous three steps are also discarded. Please see the <a href="https://nunofonseca.github.io/irap/">iRAP</a> <a href="http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2014/06/06/005991">documentation</a> for more details on the methods used.</p>


			<h3><a name="microarrayAnalysis">How is microarray data analysed?</a></h3>
			<p>Raw single-channel microarray intensities are normalized using <a href="https://biostatistics.oxfordjournals.org/content/4/2/249.long">RMA</a> via the <a href="https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/oligo.html">oligo</a> package from <a href="https://www.bioconductor.org/">Bioconductor</a> (<a href="https://www.affymetrix.com/">Affymetrix</a> data) or using quantile normalization via the <a href="https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/limma.html">limma</a> package (<a href="https://www.genomics.agilent.com/">Agilent</a> data). Two-channel <a href="https://www.genomics.agilent.com/">Agilent</a> data is normalized using LOESS via the <a href="https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/limma.html">limma</a> package. Pairwise comparisons are performed using a moderated <i>t</i>-test for each gene using <a href="https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/limma.html">limma</a>.</p>


			<h3><a name="rnaseqAnalysis">How is RNA-seq data analysed?</a></h3>
			<p>RNA-seq data is analysed using the <a href="https://nunofonseca.github.io/irap/">iRAP</a> pipeline. Quality-filtered reads are aligned to the latest version of the reference genome from <a href="https://www.ensembl.org/index.html">Ensembl</a> using <a href="https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/gb-2013-14-4-r36">TopHat2</a>. Raw counts (number of mapped reads summarized and aggregated over each gene) are generated using  <a href="https://www-huber.embl.de/HTSeq/doc/count.html">htseq-count</a>. Then, FPKM (fragments per kilobase of exon model per million mapped reads) and TPM (transcripts per million) are calculated. Pairwise comparisons are performed using a conditioned test based on the negative binomial distribution, using  <a href="https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DESeq.html">DESeq</a>.</p>


			<h3><a name="rnaseqUnits">What are FPKM and TPM?</a></h3>
			<p>FPKM (fragments per kilobase of exon model per million reads mapped) and TPM (transcripts per million) are the most common units reported to estimate gene expression based on RNA-seq data. Both units are calculated from the number of reads that mapped to each particular gene sequence and both units are calculated taking into account two important factors in RNA-seq:
			<ol><li>The number of reads from a gene depends on its length. One expects more reads to be produced from longer genes.</li>
				<li>The number of reads from a gene depends on the sequencing depth that is the total number of reads you sequenced. One expects more reads to be produced from the sample that has been sequenced to a greater depth.</li></ol></p>
			<p>FPKM (introduced by <a href="http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v28/n5/full/nbt.1621.html">Trapnell et al, 2010</a>) are calculated with the following formula:</p>
			<p style="text-align:center;"><img alt="fpkm formula" src="resources/images/help/fpkm.png"></p>
			<p>where <i>q<sub>i</sub></i> are raw counts (number of reads that mapped for each gene), <i>l<sub>i</sub></i> is gene length and
				<img alt="total number mapped reads" src="resources/images/help/total_number_mapped_reads.png" align="bottom"> is the total number of mapped reads. The interpretation of FPKM is that if you sequence your RNA sample again, you expect to see for gene <i>i</i>, <i>FPKM<sub>i</sub></i> reads divided by gene <i>i</i> length over a thousand and divided by the total number of reads mapped over a million.</p>
			<p><a href="https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2105-12-323">Li and Dewey, 2011</a> introduced the unit TPM and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1104.3889">Pachter, 2011</a> established the relationship between both units. It is possible to compute TPM from FPKM as follows:</p>
			<p style="text-align:center;"><img alt="tpm formula" src="resources/images/help/tpm.png"></p>


			<h3><a name="analysisMethods">How do I see how an individual experiment was analysed?</a></h3>
			<p>On any <strong>Experiment page</strong>, e.g. <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/experiments/E-MTAB-2809">RNA-seq of coding RNA of eight barley tissues from different developmental stages</a> you can see a breakdown of the analysis steps from raw data to the results you see in Expression Atlas by clicking the <img alt="analysis methods button" src="resources/images/help/am_btn.png" align="bottom"> button in the top right corner of the page.</p>

			<h3><a name="blResults">When I search in Expression Atlas, what do the Baseline Expression results show?</a></h3>
			<p>If you search for a particular gene (e.g. <strong>CFHR2</strong>), the <strong>Baseline Expression</strong> results will display all organisms and conditions in which CFHR2 is expressed above the default minimum expression level of 0.5 FPKM or 0.5 TPM.</p>
			<p>By default, we display expression data for different tissues, e.g <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/query?geneQuery=%5B%7B%22value%22%3A%22CFHR2%22%2C%22category%22%3A%22symbol%22%7D%5D&organism=&conditionQuery=%5B%5D&bs=%7B%22homo%20sapiens%22%3A%5B%22organism_part%22%5D%2C%22mus%20musculus%22%3A%5B%22organism_part%22%5D%7D#baseline">in which tissues is CFHR2 expressed?</a> but you can also use the filters to find gene expression in other conditions, such as <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/query?geneQuery=%5B%7B%22value%22%3A%22CFHR2%22%2C%22category%22%3A%22symbol%22%7D%5D&organism=&conditionQuery=%5B%5D&bs=%7B%22mus%20musculus%22%3A%5B%22cell_type%22%5D%7D&ds=%7B%22kingdom%22%3A%5B%22animals%22%5D%7D#baseline">in which mouse cell types is CFHR2 expressed?</a></p>

			<h3><a name="blHeatmapColours">In Baseline expression results, how are baseline expression levels represented?</a></h3>
			<p>In <strong>Baseline expression</strong> results you will see one heatmap per species. Each heatmap shows, for each species, all conditions (columns) and all experiments (rows) that matched your search. Expression levels are displayed in the heatmap in five different colours:</p>
			<ol><li>Grey box: expression level is below cutoff (0.5 FPKM or 0.5 TPM)</li>
				<li>Light blue box: expression level is low (between 0.5 to 10 FPKM or 0.5 to 10 TPM)</li>
				<li>Medium blue box: expression level is medium (between 11 to 1000 FPKM or 11 to 1000 TPM)</li>
				<li>Dark blue box: expression level is high (more than 1000 FPKM or more than 1000 TPM)</li>
				<li>White box: there is no data available</li></ol>


			<h3><a name="blExperimentPage">How can I see the results for each experiment in Baseline expression results?</a></h3>

			<h3><a name="similarExpression">How are similarly expressed genes computed?</a></h3>
			<p>Similarly expressed genes across conditions in baseline experiments (e.g. tissues, developmental stages) are shown where available. They are computed on per-experiment basis, for experiments with three or more conditions. The method for estimating them involves two steps. The first one involves k-means clustering (for all possible values of k, capped to 100) of the expression of each gene across (e.g.) tissues. The second step compares the clusters on a gene-to-gene basis and outputs a ranked list of genes with decreasing similarity of expression patterns for each gene. The top 50 similarly expressed genes can be explored on our interface. Lowly expressed genes are filtered out from the calculation. The method has been implemented within the Bioconductor package <a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/html/clusterSeq.html">ClusterSeq</a>.</p>


			<h3><a name="deResults">When I search in Expression Atlas, what do the Differential Expression results show?</a></h3>
			<p>If you search for a particular gene (e.g. <strong>CFHR2</strong>), in the <strong>Differential expression</strong> results you will see <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/query?geneQuery=%5B%7B%22value%22%3A%22CFHR2%22%2C%22category%22%3A%22symbol%22%7D%5D&organism=&conditionQuery=%5B%5D&bs=%7B%22homo%20sapiens%22%3A%5B%22organism_part%22%5D%2C%22mus%20musculus%22%3A%5B%22organism_part%22%5D%7D&ds=%7B%22kingdom%22%3A%5B%22animals%22%5D%7D#differential">all comparisons in all species in which CFHR2 is differentially expressed</a> (absolute value of log<sub>2</sub> fold-change &gt; 1 and adjusted p-value &lt; 0.05). Comparisons in which gene CFHR2 is differentially expressed are ordered so the one with the largest absolute value of log<sub>2</sub> fold-change is at the top. If gene CFHR2 has identical log<sub>2</sub> fold-change in several comparisons, then the one with the lower adjusted <i>p</i>-value goes first.</p>
			<p>If you search for a particular condition (e. g. <strong>liver</strong>), in the <strong>Differential expression</strong> results you will see  <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/query?geneQuery=%5B%5D&organism=&conditionQuery=%5B%7B%22value%22%3A%22liver%22%7D%5D&bs=%7B%22homo%20sapiens%22%3A%5B%22organism_part%22%5D%2C%22bos%20taurus%22%3A%5B%22organism_part%22%5D%2C%22gallus%20gallus%22%3A%5B%22organism_part%22%5D%2C%22macaca%20mulatta%22%3A%5B%22organism_part%22%5D%2C%22monodelphis%20domestica%22%3A%5B%22organism_part%22%5D%2C%22mus%20musculus%22%3A%5B%22organism_part%22%5D%2C%22ovis%20aries%22%3A%5B%22organism_part%22%5D%2C%22papio%20anubis%22%3A%5B%22organism_part%22%5D%2C%22rattus%20norvegicus%22%3A%5B%22organism_part%22%5D%2C%22xenopus%20tropicalis%22%3A%5B%22organism_part%22%5D%7D&ds=%7B%22kingdom%22%3A%5B%22animals%22%5D%7D#differential">all comparisons in all species that matched your search</a>. When several genes show differential expression you will see one row per each gene and comparison. Comparisons are ordered following the same criteria as explained before.</p>
			<p>In both cases, you can narrow down the results displayed using the filters in the left where you can select a particular species (e.g. Mus musculus), experimental variable (e.g. compound) to see which comparisons involve the treatment of liver with a compound in mouse.</p>
			<p>Click on the Comparison name (e.g. <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/experiments/E-MTAB-2445?geneQuery=ENSMUSG00000026839&queryFactorValues=g1_g5&specific=false">'CCl4; 1.6 gram per kilogram' at '24 hour' vs 'none' at '0 hour'</a>) to find out more information about a particular gene-comparison combination. In microarray experiments, some genes may be targeted by more than one probe set. The table in the <strong>Differential expression</strong> results shows the values for the probe set with the largest absolute log<sub>2</sub> fold-change. You can see details of all probe sets for a given gene on the Experiment page. For example, <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/experiments/E-MTAB-2445?accessKey=&serializedFilterFactors=&queryFactorType=&rootContext=&heatmapMatrixSize=50&displayLevels=false&displayGeneDistribution=false&arrayDesignAccession=&geneQuery=%5B%7B%22value%22%3A%22Car3%22%2C%22category%22%3A%22symbol%22%7D%5D&regulation=UP_DOWN&_queryFactorValues=1&specific=true&_specific=on&cutoff=0.05&foldChangeCutOff=1.0">gene Car3 is represented by 4 probe sets</a> in the experiment <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/experiments/E-MTAB-2445">Transcriptional responses in liver upon acute CCl4 intoxication</a>.</p>


			<h3><a name="designElement">What is a "design element"?</a></h3>
			<p>On microarray experiment pages, you will see the <strong>design element</strong> name alongside the gene name. A design element is also known as a probe or probe set. This is the oligonucleotide probe (or group thereof) on the microarray that targets that gene.</p>


			<h3><a name="comparison">What is a "comparison"?</a></h3>
			<p>A <strong>comparison</strong> is where two groups of samples are compared in a differential expression experiment. An example of a comparison is <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/experiments/E-GEOD-31138?accessKey=&serializedFilterFactors=&queryFactorType=&rootContext=&heatmapMatrixSize=50&displayLevels=false&displayGeneDistribution=false&arrayDesignAccession=&geneQuery=%5B%5D&regulation=UP_DOWN&_queryFactorValues=1&cutoff=0.05&foldChangeCutOff=1.0">'breast cancer' <i>vs.</i> 'normal'</a>.</p>
			<p>For each gene, the mean expression level of the <strong>test</strong> group (e.g. breast cancer) is compared with the mean expression level of the <strong>reference</strong> group (e.normal), and a statistical test is performed to decide whether the two means are significantly different.</p>


			<h3><a name="deHeatmapColours">What do the red and blue colours mean in the Differential expression results?</a></h3>
			<p>Let's search for the condition <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/query?geneQuery=%5B%5D&organism=&conditionQuery=%5B%7B%22value%22%3A%22breast%20cancer%22%7D%5D&bs=%7B%22homo%20sapiens%22%3A%5B%22cell_line%22%5D%7D&ds=%7B%22kingdom%22%3A%5B%22animals%22%5D%7D#differential">breast cancer in a differential context</a>. A red box indicates that the gene is <strong>up-regulated</strong> in the test condition while a blue box means that the gene is <strong>down-regulated</strong> in the test condition. The colour intensity of filled boxes in the table represents how large the log<sub>2</sub> fold-change is for each gene. The larger the log<sub>2</sub> fold-change, the more intense the red or blue colour.</p>
			<p>The two bars above the Differential expression results table show the red and blue colour intensities for the <strong>top 50</strong> genes shown on the page. The colour intensities represent the log<sub>2</sub> fold-changes for the genes shown.</p>


			<h3><a name="displayLogFoldChanges">How do I see the actual log<sub>2</sub> fold-changes in the Differential expression results table?</a></h3>
			<p>Click on the <img alt="Display Log2 Fold-Change button" src="resources/images/help/displayLog2FC_btn.png" align="bottom"> button to the top left corner of the table to see the numerical values of the log<sub>2</sub> fold-change per each gene in each comparison.</p>


			<h3><a name="pvalue">Where do the <i>p</i>-values come from?</a></h3>
			<p>In a microarray experiment, each gene's mean expression level in the <strong>test</strong> group is compared with its mean expression level in the <strong>reference</strong> group using a moderated <i>t</i>-test. This is done using the <a href="https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/2.13/bioc/html/limma.html">limma</a> package from <a href="https://www.bioconductor.org/">Bioconductor</a>.</p>
			<p>In an RNA-seq experiment, each gene's mean expression level in the <strong>test</strong> group is compared with its mean expression level in the <strong>reference</strong> group using a conditioned test based on the negative binomial distribution, analogous to Fisher's exact test. This is done using the <a href="https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/2.13/bioc/html/DESeq.html">DESeq</a> package in <a href="https://www.bioconductor.org/">Bioconductor</a>.</p>
			<p>Because the same test is done on thousands of genes at once, <i>p</i>-values are adjusted for <strong>multiple testing</strong> using the <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2346101">Benjamini and Hochberg (1995)</a> false discovery rate (FDR) correction. This is what is meant by <strong>adjusted <i>p</i>-value</strong>.</p>


			<h3><a name="gseaPlots">How are the gene set enrichment plots created?</a></h3>
			<p>Gene set enrichment analysis is performed using the <a href="https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/piano.html">Piano</a> package from <a href="https://www.bioconductor.org/">Bioconductor</a>. For each comparison, enrichment of terms from <a href="http://www.geneontology.org/">GO</a>, <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/">InterPro</a>, and <a href="http://www.reactome.org/">Reactome</a> is tested for within the set of differentially expressed genes, using a variation on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher%27s_exact_test">Fisher's exact test</a>.  Gene set enrichment plots are only shown when statistically significant enrichment of terms was detected. This means that for some experiments, the menu will not display plots for all three of the aforementioned resources.</p>


			<h3><a name="deDownloadAnalytics">Can I download the differential expression results?</a></h3>
			<p>Yes, click on the <img alt="Download All Results button" src="resources/images/help/downloadAllResults_btn.png" align="bottom"> button above the heatmap to download the data corresponding to your query. For example, in <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/experiments/E-GEOD-73131">Transcription profiling by array of pancreatic islets from Sgpp2 knockout mice after high fat diet</a> if you select just one comparison, e.g. 'high fat diet' vs 'normal' in 'Sgpp2 knockout' from the <strong>Comparison</strong> box and click Apply, by clicking on the <strong>Download all results</strong> button you will download <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/experiments/E-GEOD-73131?accessKey=&serializedFilterFactors=&queryFactorType=&rootContext=&heatmapMatrixSize=50&displayLevels=false&displayGeneDistribution=false&arrayDesignAccession=&geneQuery=%5B%5D&regulation=UP_DOWN&queryFactorValues=g3_g1&_queryFactorValues=1&specific=true&_specific=on&cutoff=0.05&foldChangeCutOff=1.0">expression data for the subset of genes differentially expressed in that particular comparison</a> in tab-delimited format with no ordering.</p>
			<p>On the other hand, by clicking on the <img alt="Download button" src="resources/images/help/download_button.png" align="bottom"> button in the top left corner of the Experiment page you will download expression data for all genes in all comparisons studied in the experiment.</p>
