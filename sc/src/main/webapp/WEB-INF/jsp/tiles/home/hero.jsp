        <p class="margin-top-xlarge">The cell is a natural unit of biology, whose type and state can vary according to external influences or to internal processes.
            In multicellular organisms, all cells are derived from a single zygote which, through regulated programmes of
            proliferation and differentiation, generates all of the diverse cell types that populate the organism.
            Dysregulation of these programmes in single ‘renegade’ cells can lead to diseases such as cancers, neurological
            disorders and developmental disorders .
