                    <h3>Analysing gene expression for single cells experiments</h3>
                    <p>The cell is a natural unit of biology, whose type and state can vary according to external influences or to internal processes.
                        In multicellular organisms, all cells are derived from a single zygote which, through regulated programmes of
                        proliferation and differentiation, generates all of the diverse cell types that populate the organism.
                        Dysregulation of these programmes in single ‘renegade’ cells can lead to diseases such as cancers, neurological
                        disorders and developmental disorders .
                    </p>

                    <blockquote class="lead quote industry-color">You could think of DNA sequencing as a fruit smoothie.  Traditional sequencing technology is a bit like taking a sip of the smoothie, then trying to guess what the ingredients are. <b>Single-cell genomics</b> now lets us study the ingredients individually, so we get direct insight into the constituent parts. Extrapolating, this means that single-cell sequencing allows researchers to individually look at thousands of genes at any given time.
